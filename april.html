				roman port city, back when the river and the sea met at a different place than they do now.
				mike got to see all sorts of ruins, kind of like at pompeii, but not as cool.

				today we planned on catching up on homework and the website, so when we finally got up and moving
				we went up to the school.  which was closed! supposed to be open, no reason why it wasn't open, nothing 
				posted, no signs, and when mike, enraged, called the phone number he found for the school, they claimed
				they didnt even know that the school was supposed to be open, and was agitated that mike was distracting him
				from the jcu soccer tournament which was much more important than academics for the weekend!

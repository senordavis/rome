the association against triumphal arches was really nothing other than mike
being against seeing the "arc de triumph" in paris, france. he was boycotting
seeing the arch, because he had been encountered with so many arches in his lifetime
and in his study that he no longer wanted to deal with, or see them. when mike and
leanne returned home after their trip to paris, some friends asked if we had gone to
see the triumphal arch in paris. leanne was quick to respond with no and proceded to
tell the story you just read. this happened to be during our art history class together,
and our professor and some people in class found this shocking. so thus the creation of
the association against triumphal arches.

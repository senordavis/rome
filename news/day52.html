				today is it. another day full of exams.
				<p />
				mike had two of them today. history of art, and italian.
				<p />
				leanne on the other hand has to endure the torture of exams
				through the weekend. today she only has to take italian, which she
				is more than ready for, but  her other two are on monday.
				<p />
				but all in all today wasn't to bad. after italian we went home and
				brought our friend christy with us so that she could take a nap.
				(exams take a toll on everyone)
				<p />
				when christy woke up from her nap, we all went back up to school, and
				waited for the free food that was supposed to be provided by JCU. and
				yes they did provide free food, but it wasn't at all great. the burgers
				were cold cause they wouldn't bring them from where they were cooking them
				to where the people were.
				<p />
				after the disappointing barbeque we went home and hung out there doing some
				reading and what not.</div>

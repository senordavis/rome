				so we woke up today, and mike decided that plasso 'boring ass museum' massimo, didn't sound like it would be fun to go to,
				so he didn't go to class this morning. so we did laundry instead.
				<p />
				then we went to itlian class, and instead of being in the classroom, we had class on one of the terraces of the school because today was the most
				beautiful day we've seen while here. the forcast from the usa today said that it would be "abundant sun" today.
				<p />
				then we went shopping for a bit and we got leanne some really really cute and comfy pants.
				<p />
				after shopping we had made plans to go out to dinner with everyone at heartbreak, so we went there to get seats.
				<p />
				we sat down and everyone showed up soon after we had gotten there.
				<p />
				while there, we learned a new drink. its from russia aparently. its called a capricosa rosa, and its just vodka with some sugar and fresh fruit in it.
				THAT'S ALOT OF ALCHOHOL!
				<p />
				from there we all talked for a little bit in the piazza some of the crew went to get dessert. some got gelato, and christy got this amazing crepe.
				we came back home and just crashed again tired from the day.

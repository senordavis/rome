				AHHH! whats going on? i don't remember the whole your supposed
				to have test and be in school thing was actually for real!
				<p />
				well actually we did know it was for real, and boy do the teachers
				really try hard to make it so. today we had our first midterm exam.
				<p />
				it wasn't really all that bad, we just had to go to the forum and
				know about lets say everything. it was a fairly straight forward exam
				though.
				<p />
				from there we went to italian class where we had the review for that exam
				which is on thursday. it doesn't seem like it'll be to bad, just really
				really trying on the brain.
				<p />
				tonight we went out to the residence to have dinner with some friends. they
				have this italian cook book and they've been trying to make as much stuff out
				of it as they can. tonight they made this baked ziti that was probablly the best
				baked ziti either of us has ever had. (yes mom even better than fazollis)
				<p />
				we came home studied a little more and then went to bed.

				and it came to pass that there was no class in the morning, and thus
				mike and leanne ventured off to pompeii, to see the ruins of a once
				great city.
				<p />
				and thats very much what we did. mike didn't have class this morning
				cause it was just canceled since the begging of the semester. and 
				because leanne doesn't have class on thursday mornings anyways we
				up and got on a train and went to pompeii.
				<p />
				this did require that we skip italian class, but we figured that it would
				be worth skipping on such a nice day to go out and see the ruins of an
				ancient city that was destroyed by a volcano that they say is going to 
				erupt again soon. (don't quote us on that, its just what we've heard)
				<p />
				but we walked around pretty much the entire city, and it is just amazing.
				it just strikes awe in you to see this entire city, almost completely the
				same as it was about 2000 years ago. granted you can't see it all as if it
				were built yesterday, but you have almost all the walls, and streets and 
				paintings, and pots. its incedible.
				<p />
				we were there for most of the day and walked and saw most everything that 
				has been identified. afterwards we stopped in naples to go to the pizza
				place there that we love. we got into naples at about 2:45 and they close at
				3:30. so we got into a taxi cab, and made it our there by 3:00. this was the
				craziest taxi ride we had ever taken in our lives, but we got there on time,
				and were able to eat and enjoy. we walked back to the train station to work
				off all the calories we had just consumed and them made it back home at a decent
				time so that we could sleep before leaving again tommorow.

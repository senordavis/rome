				while walking around yesterday we saw a sign on church about a very cool palm sunday service.
				so we had decided that we would go to it.
				<p />
				we got up much earlier though and because it was sunny, decided to walk through green park.
				<p />
				we walked through the park to the palace. when we got there we saw that they were wearing the red coats
				today. We still couldn't get to them to be able to play with their hats and things like that, so we
				walked around to see if we could find other ones. we soon realized that this just wasn't going to to be 
				possible, so we made our way back around the palace and headed off to the arch where we would be meeting
				for the church service.
				<p />
				on our way to the arch, we walked through st. james park which was gorgeous. it had a fun river through
				it which we walked by and saw some interesting birds.
				<p />
				we made it to the arch and processed to the church being led by a donkey.
				<p />
				after the church service we went off on our day.
				<p />
				we stopped of for lunch at one of the nicest mcdonalds ever.
				<p />
				we then took the underground and walked by the tower of london and across the tower bridge.
				<p />
				our next stop was the design museum. because the UK is the number one place for design, they have an
				entire museum devoted to it. we walked through a weird exhibition about the design/architecture firm
				that has apparently done some really cool things, and are big into the whole future thing.
				<p />
				after that we walked up to designer of the year exhibit. this is where they pick four people out of all
				the nominated designers (UK born or working in the UK) that will be voted on by people who visit the
				museum to see who is the designer of the year. this is of course a very difficult task seeing as in how
				they are all designers of different things, but are all amazing at what they do.
				<p />
				after the design museum we walked along the river and saw the HMS belfast, and then found this random
				cafe area. we sat at another starbucks to warm up, and then kept walking.
				<p />
				we found Shakespeare's globe theatre.
				<p />
				we then walked across the millenium bridge, and then made our way back to the hostel to use the internet.
				the hostel was having problems with their connection so we went to the burger king on the corner which
				had an internet cafe inside it. mike enrolled in his classes for summer, and for the fall.
				<p />
				after that and checking email and sending some out we went back to pizza hut for dinner, and then went
				back to the hostel for bed.

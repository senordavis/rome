			  	<div class="main">
				today we layed in bed, and we contemplated how early we should get up to get to class today, but mike's knee
				said to him: "hey i don't think you should go, i think it's gonna rain."
				<p />
				so instead of going to class to see the baths of caracala we stayed at home and then went to the school.
				<p />
				we sat there and played on the internet, and mike applied to a job on campus to see if he could get some more
				money.
				<p />
				then we went to italian class, and that was about as fun as being stuck in a giant vat of marshmellow cream.
				you think it'd be fun cause marshmellow cream is fun, but really its not.
				<p />
				afterwards, we went to blue ice to get gelato with sonya. instead of raining it actually turned out to be a gorgeous day.
				mike celebrated by staring at the flooded tiber. (you don't even understand the extreme happiness that came from the tiber being flooded)
				<p />
				we dinked aronud for the rest of the afternoon until we had to go to the residence to meet up with people for dinner at the pizza
				place.
				<p />
				after dinner we came home and just crashed from exhaustion.

				after going to sleep early we kinda woke up early today. leanne of course got up much
				earlier than mike. mike just kinda layed in bed for a while.
				<p />
				while mike was in bed, leanne finished up her annotated bibliography for her classes.
				<p />
				when mike woke up he started working on his paper. leanne went through and cleaned the apartment
				and got rid of things that we didn't need, or weren't bringing home. she also went through and packed
				things ups that we weren't going to use or need for the rest of the time here. but after she was all
				done with that she didn't have anything really to do and mike needed a break so we went out for some gelato
				and to sit at the park for bit.
				<p />
				after our time outside it was back to work for mike, while leanne sat and bugged him for a bit. just enough
				to keep him happy while working on the boring art history paper.
				<p />
				mike called it quits on the paper for the day, and we just kinda hung out for a while after that.
				nikki and mandy called us to go to dinner with them so we met up with them and went to this place in
				piazza navonna that we hadn't tried before. the waiter was reall fun, and the host was very entertaining.
				<p />
				afterwards we headed down to the pub that we went to last week to see game five, but the guy running the bar was
				completely not cool, and made it so that we missed the detroit game and tried to convince us that we were waiting for
				the colorado game to start at one but we weren't so we left.
				<p />
				we stopped to get some sandwhiches on the way home cause we were still a little hungry cause portions at dinner were kinda
				small, and then came home and went to bed.

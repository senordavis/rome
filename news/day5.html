We sat in a little restaurant and ate Italian style. We had				bread, and a first and second course, and wine to drink with it all.				</div>				<hr size="1">				<div><a class="link2" href="../news.html">news</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="link2" href="day4.html">previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="link2" href="day6.html">next</a></div>			</td>	    </tr>	</table></body></html>

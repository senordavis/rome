				well we told ourselves that we would need two days to see everything in 
				florence, and to enjoy it all, but really we didn't.
				<p />
				well there were things that we saw today that we couldn't have seen, but
				there wasn't really much that we could enjoy. most of it had to do with the
				fact that the weather was so horrible, but the other was that there isn't
				as much to do in florence as we thought there was.
				<p />
				we did go and see the david, and that was amazing. it was unfourtunatly being
				restored, but we still saw it. the restoration of it is actually very interesting.
				all the different things that they are doing to preserve it and keep it in as good
				of shape as it is, or can be.
				<p />
				while in florence we also saw one of mikes favorite sculptures. we saw both the copy
				and the original. its called the rape of the sabine women, and it is carved entirely out
				of one piece of marble.
				<p />
				after we had seen the museum where the david is in, we went and sat in a park and ate
				some fruit that we had boughten at this huge market that they have in florence. its just
				this giant building that has two floors. they have fruit and vegtables on the second, and
				meat, fish, and cheese, on the first.
				<p />
				after that we decided that we were done with florence, and because it wasn't nice out we
				didn't stop in sienna and just went home.
				<p />
				when we got to rome we came out of the train station and there was just hoards of people
				everywhere. aparently there was some big peace rally. the bus that we normally take to get
				home was diverted to a completely differernt route to parts of the city that we had never
				seen. we ended up having to walk from St. peters home.

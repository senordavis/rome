				how happy we are to be back in rome. back at the apartment.
				<p />
				yes, yes, a few days ago you read about how happy we were to get away from everything
				and just be somewhere else, but it always feels good to be back home. (as much as we 
				can call this home)
				<p />
				but we had been looking forward to being back in the apartment on sunday that its become
				somewhat of a ritual, or a tradition almost. we walk up and lay in bed talking, and then
				do some homework, or some typing, and then mike goes and makes the breakfast feast of
				johnny cakes, and we indulge our appetites on the large amount of those. (we aren't able
				to eat lunch we have had so many)
				<p />
				after that mike was going to get all of his programing done, but wasn't able to because
				he is still getting over being sick, so he went to sleep for the middle portion of the
				day. leanne on the other hand went off to school to get some other stuff done, plan her
				school schedule for the coming school year, and look into some housing information for 
				when we get back.
				<p />
				we did some grocery shopping, and then sat around a bit, went to dinner and then off to
				church. which again was an amazing service. for the three weeks that we have been, the
				homily has been wonderful each time.
				<p />
				afterwards we came home and leanne put mike to bed so that he could get some rest and
				feel better.

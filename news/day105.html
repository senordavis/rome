				not much to say about today.  we woke up and got all ready for school.  then spent the day there.
				mike had a project to work on with mandy (and yes you read that right, mike had school work to do again today)
				and leanne had finished all that she had so, she got to sit in the sun (shade, the italian sun burns her faster than
				the michigan sun) and read all morning before class.
				<P />
				however, her professor changed all her thoughts of relaxation for the rest of teh semester by handing out a review sheet,
				which she is thankful for, but requires work.  and then additionally, she has three take home final exam essays
				that must all be written, typed, proofed and at least two pages a piece, by monday.  its the last weekend in rome, no one wants 
				to be writing essays on the last weekend in rome!
				<P />
				so after class, the night was spent doing homework.  mike had to finish up the project and leanne needed to start in on 
				this review.
				<P />
				to make the night of studying even better, we discovered that the gas leak that was fixed yesterday moved to the other 
				burner and is leaking faster than the other one.  we couldn't reach anyone on the phone from jcu (not sure why) so we 
				slept with the windows open and hope that they will fix it tomorrow.

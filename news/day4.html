Leanne				had a coke and i got a cappuchino and we ate some really good paninni's.				<p>				for the rest of the night we just sat at home and talked for hours.				</div>				<hr size="1">				<div><a class="link2" href="../news.html">news</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="link2" href="day3.html">previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="link2" href="day5.html">next</a></div>			</td>	    </tr>	</table></body></html>

(in terms thats easier to understand:				the site was visited 100 times yesterday and multiple pages were viewed.) but as exciting as that				may be, we havn't recieved nearly that many emails.  "whats going on people!"				<p />				anyways, back to our day. after laundry and internet stuff, we had lunch at home, and then went off				to class. leanne went to school and mike had to walk to Piazza del Popolo, which really isn't as close				as he thought. while there it started to rain (mainly because leanne forgot to take her umbrealla to school				with her, just a little joke we have).				<p />				mike ran home and dropped of his sketchbook and ran up to meet leanne before she got out of class. from there				we walked out to the mothers office of the family that wants leanne to tutor their 14 year old daughter. that				was also much farther than we thought.				<p />				we sat there for about an hour and a half, and then went out to the residence that all the other people from				MSU are at and went to our friend nikki's birthday party				<p />				there was alot of walking, alot of rain, and alot of fun				</div>				<hr size="1">				<div><a class="link2" href="../news.html">news</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;					 <a class="link2" href="day22.html">previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;					 <a class="link2" href="day24.html">next</a></div>			</td>	    </tr>	</table></body></html>

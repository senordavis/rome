				you know how in those movies when the bad guy catches the good
				guy while he's trying to break into the bad guys place and either
				rescue someone or do something all heroic and stuff, but then he
				gets caught and the bad guy either makes him wait until he tortures
				him, or tortures him really really slowly?
				<p />
				well if you do then you know how today was. it was just and agonizingly
				slow day. midterms are tommorow for mike, and then on monday for leanne.
				it just seems like they prolong the process and make it as painful as possible.
				<p />
				but other than that whole thing it wasn't to bad of a day. we went to the gym again
				this morning (2 days in a row) and today we went to a stepping class. mike was the only
				male in the class, but that was okay. he looked kinda goofy, and couldn't really stay in
				step with everyone else. however we are both very sore now. because yesterday we ran for
				about an hour, and then today we did step class for an hour.
				<p />
				for the rest of the day leanne did the class thing, and then went out to tutor, and mike
				sat and studied and played on the computer learning xhtml, and how to set a page up without
				using tables.(if you don't really understand that part its fine. basiclly its a different and better
				way to code and design websites.)
				<p />
				for dinner tonight we went back out to the pizzeria by the residence because some of christy's friends
				were in town, and it has become tradition that the first night that anyone comes to visit us in rome
				we take them out there.
				<p />
				afterwards we walked home, and crashed

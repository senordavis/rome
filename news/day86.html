				today just like almost everyother day, leanne woke up while mike splet in.
				<p />
				while mike was sleeping leanne was very productive and started in on her paper that she had
				put off all day yesterday.
				<p />
				while leanne was working on her paper, she soon discoverd that although we found a way to
				make coffee... no wait i'll just let her tell you, this is from the sticky notes that she 
				writes so that mike doesnt forget what happened during the week: and i quote
				<blockquote>
				"the newest thing that i have discovered is that i cant wait to get home to: coffee cups.  
				we have no shortage of them at home, and at home they are even considered a nuosiance 
				because you always have so many and they are always gaughty and given as gifts when 
				you are not quite sure what to get, but here there are none, and when all you want is 	
				to drink the coffee that you finally figured out how to make at the apartment, you need a
				coffee cup, not these silly itty bitty tea cups that are barely even big enough for tea.  
				I take that back, I have obviously not figured out how to make coffee, but i blame the lack of coffee cups and teaspoons!"
				</blockquote>
				after the coffe incident, she kept working on her paper for the rest of the day cause her classes were cancelled.
				<p />
				later that night, mike decided to play some video games on the computer. that turned into an all night battle with the orc's and
				undead, and other evil enemies.

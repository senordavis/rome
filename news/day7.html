Leanne had a pretty full load				where as mike had no classes today and sat in the library and played on the internet				and his computer.				<p>				we went to a bookstore and picked up one of Leanne's books for class before she had to				be back at school. She feels kind of amiss about class and what not. she knows that				we are here for school, but feels like she really wants to be done with it. It is a				very interesting situation.				<p>				overall it was quite a good day. nothing to bad, just an intro to the classes and figuring				out a little bit more of how things are going to be.				<p>				we've also been hanging out with some of the people in our group from MSU. we went to lunch				today with a few of them and they are planning on coming over tommorow night and chilling at				our place. we might head out to the bar or something like that later on.				<p>				it started out like it was going to warm up, but it ended up raining this evening. it wasn't				to bad, but it did get a little chilly.				</div>				<hr size="1">				<div><a class="link2" href="../news.html">news</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="link2" href="day6.html">previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="link2" href="day8.html">next</a></div>			</td>	    </tr>	</table></body></html>

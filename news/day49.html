				so no matter how much you do on a day to try and get ahead,
				you never really catch up.
				<p />
				today leanne had class, and mike started to work on the large task of
				redesigning the photostyle website, and everything in general.
				<p />
				but the fun came later that evening.
				<p />
				it was our turn to cook dinner tonight, and we were doing rice and beans.
				but along the way we ran into a few problems,
				<p />
				<b>problem No. 1:</b><br />
				we had all the food we needed to make dinner, but we couldn't get to it.
				the beans were in a can. and until today, we hadn't really noticed that
				we didn't have a can opener, so mike tried to open it, and then leanne did
				open it. (all of this with a corkscrew mind you)
				<p />
				<b>problem No. 2:</b><br />
				yes we were provided with pans and pots and things like that, but they are
				horrible. we can take and if we really wanted to bend both of our pots closed.
				they are just mad of very very thin tin.
				<p />
				this made things quite interesting, but needless to say, it turend out allright.

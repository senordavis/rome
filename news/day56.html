				today in 44 BC, Julius Ceaser was assasinated not far from where we live.
				<p />
				that wondeful piece of information aside. today was the day that leanne had
				those two horrible, horrible exams.
				<p />
				so after leanne went and worked out and bought mike some medicine, we headed up to
				the school so that leanne could go over her notes again.
				<p />
				after the exams we went and got some gelato. just to celebrate that she got through
				the exams.
				<p />
				later that night we headed out to the residence to have dinner at our friend mandy's.
				she had gotten some taco seasoning from her mom when she came, so it was a big mexican
				fiesta.
				<p />
				after the mexican fiesta, we went home and went to bed.

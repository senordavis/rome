				<div class="subtitle">best pizza in the world!</div>

				and thats literally what it is. we have been all over the world and this place has the best pizza we have ever 
				tasted.
				<p />
				today because we only had one train day left, and we wanted to use all of them, and didn't know what else to do,
				we went to naples, again, to the pizza place run by that family to have pizza.
				<p />
				it took us a two hour train ride, and it was a very packed train ride. mike doesn't like crowds and gets a little
				bit anxious and nerveous and what not around them. the train ride was a big test of his patience with this then.
				<p />
				but we made it to naples alright and we able to take another crazy taxi ride up to the pizza place. today it was 
				wonderful we almost ran over the people in front of us on a scooter and then almost hit an old lady.
				<p />
				but we got to the pizza place and then had our pizza.
				<p />
				when we were done we made it back to the train station, and got back to rome with enough time to go home, talk to
				our families and changed.
				<p />
				we had found a place where we were going to go to easter vigil mass in english. so we took off to catch a bus to
				go out there, but all the busses were full so we had to take a taxi.
				<p />
				we got there and it was pretty full, but we ended up sitting in a great place for the service.
				<p />
				after the service we ended up going to the bus stop and catching the bus home. unfortunatly while on the bus 
				leanne had her wallet stolen. luckily there were only credit cards and things that we could replace. no cash. but
				the real sad part about it is that it was her fun sleeping beauty wallet that we bought her cause she loves 
				sleeping beauty.
				<p />
				we came home and called the credit card companies and had all of them cancelled. then we called the stupid school
				which was of no help. apparently all emergencies have to wait until tuesday when the school is open. even though
				it is an emergency phone number so that in case anything happens you can call them for help. but having your 
				apartment keys missing and just being robbed is not an emergency.
				<p />
				mike was fumming! but we talked to mom and calmed down and went for a walk to get some food and talked to one of 
				the girls that we met here that use to work at our restaurant here in campo, but now works at the new take away 
				place that they opened. we talked to her for a bit and then came home to bed.

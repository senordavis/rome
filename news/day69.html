				<div class="title">Day 69</div>				
				<div class="subtitle">another wonderful day</div>				
				<div class="date">Sunday, 28 March, 2004</div>
				<br>
				<div class="main">
				we slept well and woke up very rested.
				<p />
				we ate the provided breakfast that was in our room. it was just some toast,
				coffee and tea.
				<p />
				we took our time getting ready cause we woke up early, or so we thought. we
				watched some tv while eating breakfast, and were watching the marathon that
				was going on in rome for the day.
				<p />
				we finished getting ready, and then packed everything, and started on our way
				out. one of the maids that was cleaning came out and gave us an angry look,
				but we thought nothing of it.
				<p />
				from there we made our way back to the hostel office, and turned in the keys.
				on our way back to the office though we encountered tons of people just running
				and walking like because they couldn't make it to rome they would just have there
				own marathon. come to find out they were having there own marathon. it was actually
				a non competetive march. the poster for it was cool, so mike stole one from the "bus stop"
				<p />
				we ended up getting 24 hour bus passes cause it worked out cheaper to do that than to pay for
				all the rides that we were going to take today. the attendant told mike that he was supposed to
				take leanne any where she wanted to go with the passes that we had just bought.
				<p />
				we got the tickets and went to see the monument mike wanted to see, and then walked through a park
				that leanne thought looked cool, and then we did what leanne wanted to do which was to go and sit
				somewhere looking at the water.
				<p />
				so we went back to the street that we found that overlooked the water cause we had found
				a restaurant and a dessert place that we wanted to try.
				<p />
				so we sat down at the restaurant and sat there in the sun for a few hours, and then went next
				door to the dessert place.
				<p />
				when we were all done we headed back to the train station to try and get an earlier train. when
				we got there we looked at the clock and it said it was an hour ahead of what either of us thought.
				but with our experience in rome and all the clocks there that are off we thought nothing of it until
				we got inside and all the clocks there said that it was an hour ahead, and all the trains that were
				leaving were an hour ahead of what time we thought it was.
				<p />
				we weren't completly sure but went to the ticket window anyways. we tried to get an earlier train but it was
				full. after that we went to the turist office to ask if there had been a time change. the guy there looked at
				us confused, but after we explained it a little he understood what we were talking about.
				<p />
				we soon after finding out that it had been day light savings realized why the maid was angry this morning. check
				out was at 10 and we thought we were leaving at 9:30 but it was actually 10:30.
				<p />
				so now that we had 2 hours instead of 3 we hopped back on the bus and went to see a church that we had wanted
				to see and then went back to the train station and came home.

				breakfast was a very interesting experience. we walked into a room, and they
				just were making toast up the yang.
				<p />
				that about all that they had, but it was still good and free.
				<p />
				we weren't really all the hungry so we ate some toast and ran cause we had a lot to see.
				<p />
				we went and started walking around the area where we were staying, and saw that the lion king
				was playing, so we went and found a place and bought some tickets.
				<p />
				after buying our really expensive tickets, we found a starbucks. it wasn't really hard to do seeing
				as in how they are more popular in london than they are at home. there was one on almost everyblock.
				they are almost as popular as mcdonalds are back in the states.
				<p />
				after we had our starbucks coffe, we went and found some of the big sites.
				<p />
				we first went to trafalgers square. it is the center of london. it has some really really cool
				sculptures, and a big museum that's free.
				<p />
				from the square we went and walked the mall. its this big street that runs right into the palace.
				while walking down the mall we saw some of the queen's mounted gaurds riding towards somewhere.
				<p />
				we got to the end of the mall, and made it to the palace where we were waiting to see the changing of
				the guard, which was very disappointing. first off they were not wearing their red coats, and there
				wasn't as much fan fare as we were hoping, but it's cool to say that we saw it. after they were done
				though, two other guards came out and started messing with the new gaurds. leanne thinks that they
				were just inspecting them, but mike thinks that they were testing them to see if they could hack it.
				<p />
				after the palace we went to the area where westminster abbey is. we stopped into a grocery store, and 
				bought some bread, and had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch.
				<p />
				when we finished lunch, we made our way into westminster abbey. its actually a little bit creepy
				inside. its just this giant church with a whole bunch of dead people in it. just everywhere you look
				dead person here, dead person there. it was crazy.
				<p />
				<p>after going through the abbey we of course saw big ben, its really kinda hard to miss. we tried to get
				into the house of parliment but it was closed for the day. we then crossed the bridge and saw the
				london eye, its like a ferris wheel for grown ups (and about 100 times bigger). it takes a half hour
				to get around and you can see all of london from there.</p>
				<p />
				while we were there we found this aquarium. so we went in it, and it was great. mike loved it so much
				that we spent a few hours there.
				<p />
				by the time we got through the whole thing we ran back to the hostel, changed, and went off to find
				our way to the theater where the lion king was playing. mike forgot to bring the london book so we
				didn't have our map and were franticly walking around trying to find where we needed to go.
				<p />
				we got there just in time.
				<p />
				the show was awesome. the set was amazing. things spinning and comming out of the floor, things hanging
				from the ceiling, just everything was totally great. the costumes the music. it was awesome!
				<p />
				after  the show we made our way back towards the hostel and stopped at a pizza hut for dinner.

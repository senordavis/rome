				again a pretty much nothing day again.
				<p />
				mike slept in (again), and then we just kinda lingered around the apartment
				until it was time to go to school for leannes classes.
				<p />
				leanne had class today because here they have "make up classes." which in is
				basicly that the professor has canceled class for a day, or either the school
				has canceled class for a day and so they scheduled a day when the classes would
				be made up.
				<p />
				so leanne went to class while mike sat in the library. when leanne got out of class,
				we did some stuff on the computer and found out about a barbeque that the school was
				having. so we stayed around for some free food.
				<p />
				after hanging out at the school for a bit and doing some more computer work, we went
				home and went to bed.

				so we decided that today we would go to class.
				<p />
				for art history the class was going to some catacombs way the hell out there.
				<p />
				even though they were cool, it didn't really seem like it was to worth it. we waited around for a half
				hour at the bus station for everyone to get there. then it took us 45 minutes to get there. once there
				we had to wait 15 minutes to be able to go down into them cause they had a few tours already down there.
				the tour lasted about 20 minutes and then it took us about 40 minutes to get back to the bus station.
				<p />
				for italian though we watch a very very odd italian movie.
				<p />
				after italian class we went home dropped stuff off, and then walked around for bit. we had some gelato,
				found something kind like a park. we sat in the park for a while, before going to a new place we hadn't
				tried for dinner.
				<p />
				after dinner we came home and read for a while before going to sleep.
				<p />
				it was a pretty uneventful day, but tommorow is french toast night. YAY!

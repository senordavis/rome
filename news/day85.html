				today is it. no more vacations. just school, and the occasional get together and party
				you know.
				<p />
				anyways, we had decided to go up to school early cause we desperately needed the internet.
				we were going through withdrawl from not being able to write emails, and talk to people, and
				search for meaningless things. Leanne attempted to do homework, but the desire to be on the
				internet was so large taht we just wrote emails and updated websites.
				<p />
				leanne took a break and went up to student services to talk to them about our keys being stolen,
				and how someone potentially has access to our apartment. yet everyone at the school just seemed to 
				not care and told us that it wasn't a big deal. we aren't sure if this is comforting or disheartening,
				but what can you do?
				<p />
				when everyone else got up to school we sat around talking with them about what they did, and how
				things went.
				<p />
				while we were talking with everyone we took the time to complain about all that had happened
				during the weekend, and how the school didn't do anything to help us.
				<p />
				we also found out that everyone else is just as excited as we are to go home.
				<p />
				the rest of the day we just sat and worked on stuff, and then came home.

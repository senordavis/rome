				obviously, we slept in again today.  the wings game kept us out just a little late last nite.
				<p />
				today we planned on catching up on homework and the website, so when we finally got up and moving
				we went up to the school.  which was closed! supposed to be open, no reason why it wasn't open, nothing 
				posted, no signs, and when mike, enraged, called the phone number he found for the school, they claimed
				they didnt even know that the school was supposed to be open, and was agitated that mike was distracting him
				from the jcu soccer tournament which was much more important than academics for the weekend!
				<p />
				so not as much schoolwork got done, but we did accomplish some reading, and enjoyed the rainy afternoon
				at home with some hot tea.
				<P />
				plus, today is sunday. that means church day! mike and leanne both very much look forward ot going to church
				on sunday nights.  the church is really awesome, and it is always awesome to see a whole church service full
				of 20 somethings, its really great.
				<p />
				and, YAY, grandma called today! always good to hear from her, and everyone else, who we will so be seeing.  
				only three weeks left, crazy!

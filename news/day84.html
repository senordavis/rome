				yep that's what it says. today is actually a holiday here in itally.
				hardly anything is open. really its only like restaurants and a few
				shops and things like that.
				<p />
				but we decide that because it was a holiday, we would treat it as such.
				we slept in this morning and just layed around for a bit. leanne got up and
				went to the kitchen and made some hot chocolate using the left overs from the
				chocolate eggs that we had gotten for easter.
				<p />
				for the rest of the day we just sat in bed and read. leanne had a lot of reading for
				school left, and so she did that. mike read another book. his second in an entire week.
				<p />
				for dinner we had some take out pizza. and then worked on photostyle stuff. after a while
				we just went to bed early.

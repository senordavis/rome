				<div class="subtitle">goodbye london, hello brussels</div>

			  	<div class="main">
				well here it is, our last day in london. its not even really a day, its just a morning.
				<p />
				we woke up, packed everything and headed out. leanne had asked mike if he wanted to stop
				into a book store today before we left to see if he could find one of his design magazines.
				so when we woke up we walked through the tower and virgin record stores just looking around to
				kill some time before the book stores opened.
				<p />
				once the stores were open, we went into one and found a whole bunch of stuff. leanne bought the divinci
				code, and mike found his magazine. they had a sale on books, so we bought two other books. we got the
				dk travel book about brussels, a book that they were advertising that looked good to mike.
				<p />
				from the store we walked around london for a bit more, and made our way to the train station that we
				needed to be at.
				<p />
				we decided to get some lunch so we stopped into a burger king. this was the first fast food restaurant we
				had been in in all of london that wasn't fast and efficient. it was like we were in the states.
				<p />
				after lunch we went down to where we had to check in for the train. it was almost like we were in an
				airport. it was crazy, security checks and all of that.
				<p />
				it was a short train ride though.
				<p />
				we made it into brussels and were utterly confused. on top of the language being completly different than
				anything we had encountered, we couldn't figure anything else out. we eventually figured out how to get
				our ticket to go to amsterdam, but not for the life of us could we figure out the transportation thing.
				<p />
				we were almost about to just quit and not to anything. we figured out a little bit of the
				transportation thing to just be confused by it all again. we were trying to get the the grand place,
				which is supposed to be really cool, but the tram that we were on stopped and the driver said to get off.
				<p />
				thats not the best part though. we got off and didn't know where to go next, but saw the next tram that
				we needed to get on (only after consulting 3 different sources) on the other side of the platform. then
				we saw this sidewalk think that people were running across to get to the other side. it was crazy. just
				walk through the tracks its no big deal.
				<p />
				we were just done at that point so we decided to come up out of the undergound tram thing and we found
				this random pub and got some rasberry beer. (this was one of the only reasons why we stopped in brussels)
				<p />
				we then set off again to see if we could find the grand place. so we hopped back on the tram thing, and
				found our way to where we needed to go. we got off and then found a waffle place. we ate some really good
				belgian waffles just to find better ones later by the peeing boy.
				<p />
				we then made our way back to the train station before it started to pour. we found another pub and had
				some more rasberry beer.
				<p />
				we then got on out train to amsterdam.
				<p />
				once we got there we made our way to the hostel. when we got there. we saw a sign on the door that said
				<blockquote>
				"if you arive between the hours of 4pm and 1am please check in at the bar across the street.
				</blockquote>
				we went over to the bar and a girl in the back who was also the bartender took us over to the hostel,
				which was very interestingly decorated. we got our room and just went to sleep.

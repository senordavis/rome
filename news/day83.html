				HAPPY EASTER!
				<p />
				today we slept in. it was really really nice to not have to get up and go anywhere, or have to do anything.
				<p />
				when we woke up we ventured up to the vatican to see the crowds that had gathered for easter mass, and just to
				come and see the vatican on easter.
				<p />
				it was beautiful! leanne loved it very much.
				<p />
				we sat and listened to some of mass, and took some pictures of what was going on. but because we were so far away
				we took pictures of the big screen that they had so that you could see everything.
				<p />
				from there we went to the police station around the cornere and filed a police report. it won't do anything, but
				we had to file it so that we could get leanne a new permesso di soggiorno. we also called the american embassy,
				and found out that they are closed. we have heard that they aren't really helpful anyways, so we'll see.
				<p />
				we then had our easter breakfast feast. johnny cakes, empanadas (johnny cakes folded over with cheese inside),
				chocolate eggs, jelly beans and wine.
				<p />
				when we had eaten the johnny cakes, we dove into the chocolate eggs.
				<p />
				it was great you got this giant chocolate egg thing that you could smash and then find a fun suprise inside.
				probablly the best part about the suprises was that they were inside of plastic things that looked liked the pills
				from doctor mario. not eggs, not an easter shape, but big giant, real pills like what dr. mario uses.
				<p />
				inside of them the suprises were great. leanne got a tin that unzips so you can put stuff inside it. but what makes this
				tin very interesting is that on it there is minnie mouse and daisy duck talking on the phone to each other in english. why does
				an italian easter egg suprise have engilsh on it? we don't know either.
				<p />
				mike's suprise was much cooler. he got a squeeze dart gun. "it really packs a punch" he says. (he says this after drinking wine out of
				half of the chocolate egg)
				<p />
				after our feast we took a nice nap. we woke up mike cleaned the kitchen after playing around for a bit with water,
				while leanne did some homework.
				<p />
				for the rest of the night we stayed at home and just hung out in bed reading, and typing.

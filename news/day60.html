				<div class="subtitle">a weekend in Tuscany</div>

				<div class="main">
				today we are headed off to tuscany. unfourtunately for all of you
				who have seen the movie, it wasn't as gorgeous as that.
				<p />
				not to say the tuscany isn't gorgeous, but we only went to pisa, and
				florence, and it was cloudy and ick the entire time. and plus cities
				are very different than the country side, and movies make things much
				nicer than they actually are.
				<p />
				none the less, we did have a great time, we very much enjoyed seeing the
				leaning tower, and all the big beautiful churches. and just being able to
				sit and talk and be on our own for a bit.
				<p />
				from pisa, we went down to florence, and walked around there. saw some cool
				sculptures, and what not.
				<p />
				we then sat down at this place for dinner, and ate some really really good cheese.
				<p />
				after dinner we went back to our hostel and called it a night.

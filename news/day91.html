				mike spent the night reading leanne's book angels and demons.  he was so hooked, bed time didnt come until 5 in the morning.
				needless to say, when leanne woke up to go running, mike didnt come.
				<p />
				we tried to make salads at home for lunch, but apparently we havent figured out how to buy lettuce, becuase it tasted like we were 
				eating the whole gardern dirt included.
				<p />
				then it was time for leanne to go to class.  class was class, but while see was learning mike found a wonderful job oppurtunity thanks
				to christy.  its a web design job for one of the departments on campus, and it pays really well. so when leanne got out of class mike, christy 
				and leanne all went back to the apartment and mike worked on his resume.  leanne and christy "did homework" which basically means they chatted
				like girls will do.
				<p />
				dinner was at mike and leanne's place tonite. it was great.  mike had never made hamburger patties before, and was confused when leanne said, 
				no not the expense frozen patties like at home, we are going to make them.  but they turned out great. 
				<p />
				between the eight people there, there were 18 hamburgers and 8 hot dogs, two bags of chips, and they were all gone! everyone enjoyed themselves
				and the traditional american food.  it feels good to sit around with everyone and think about home, while enjoying rome.

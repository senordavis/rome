In fact you could actually see things. more impressivly, you				could see the lower half of the walls and the floor (both of which at higly decorated and ornate).				<p />				some may say why is it that cool to see the lower half of the walls or the floor? well i'll tell you.				<p />				on the floor it is mosaic tile that not only is beautiful, but was brought from different ancient roman palaces and buildings, that were excavated,				and re layed piece by piece on the floors of the museum.				<p />				then on the lower walls, are marble carvings and small statues that are very interesting to see. or busts of important figures				in history.				<p />				then we got to the good part. because there were only 30 of us in the sistine chapel, you could see everything and 				actually appreciate it much better. seeing how Michelangelo devolped his painting style to be more that of 				sculpting with paint rather than just painting is very amazing. but most of all being able to calmly and serenly enjoy this				chapel is probablly the most wonderful of all things.				<p />				after our most amazing cultural expierience we went to a very differnt cultural experience. tonight we had dinner at 				<a class="link2" href="../photos/hardrock/hardrock.html">hard rock cafe: rome</a>.				we went out with a bunch of people from school and just hung out for like 3 hours before walking home.				</div>				<hr size="1">				<div><a class="link2" href="../news.html">news</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;					 <a class="link2" href="day29.html">previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;					 <a class="link2" href="day31.html">next</a></div>			</td>	    </tr>	</table></body></html>

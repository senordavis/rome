				LEANNE FINISHED HER PAPER!!
				<p />
				why is that amazing? becuase its a week before its due. everybody say YAY!!
				<p />
				other than the huge accomplishment of finishing the paper, we worked on tons, and tons of
				photostyle stuff today.
				<p />
				mandy had invited us to go out with her and nikki and amanda to hard rock tonight, so we
				of course said yes. becuase it was raining we went to grab our broken beyond belief umbrella,
				but someone had stolen it.
				<p />
				we don't know who it was, but someone stole our umbrella. boo on them! and hopefully it breaks
				some more and they get all wet!
				<p />
				hard rock was fun, and food was really good. we've decided that we have to go back for happy hour.
				drinks are 2 for 1 and you get half off appetizers.
				<p />
				when we came home, leanne made the next photo gallery. yes you read right, she edited the html all by herself
				and resized the images, and did it all.
				<p />
				guess mike's out of a job now.

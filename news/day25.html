He is the noted alchemist who developed				the sorcerers stone which was used to make the elixer of life in the first harry potter book.				<p />				in real life he was an alchemist but nto a wizard. he offered food to the poor in exchange that they would				pray for the dead.				<p />				but once we got there and realized how expensive it was we just headed back to the hotel.				<p />				it was a really good day, we did most of our traveling across the city on the metro, which is actually a very nice				system. its very big, and has alot of trains, but it makes it really convinient to get around.				</div>				<hr size="1">				<div><a class="link2" href="../news.html">news</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;					 <a class="link2" href="day24.html">previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;					 <a class="link2" href="day26.html">next</a></div>			</td>	    </tr>	</table></body></html>

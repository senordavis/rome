				we woke up this morning after having sleeping on comfy beds, and big mexican type pillows.
				<p />
				when i say big mexican type pillows, i'm talking like huge bigger than 4 normal pillows put together.
				<p />
				but anyways, we got up, and headed up to the lounge/bar area for breakfast. it was actually very good. everywhere
				else that we have been its just been toast or something resembling toast that really isn't toast. but here we had
				yogurt, cereal, some rolls, 3 different kinds of meat to choose from, tomatoes and cheese, regular cheese, and 
				hard boiled eggs. also we could have coffee, tea, milk, or juice. or all of them if we really wanted.
				<p />
				from breakfast we packed up and checked out, and then made our way to the museum.
				<p />
				once we arrived at the zwinger (thats the name of the museum) we had a fun time trying to talk to the germans who
				didn't speak to much english. we found lockers to put our bags in, and then we were off.
				<p />
				it was a very odd museum. the paintings weren't really hung like they were in a museum, but more so as if you had
				been decorating your house. and the collection that they had was such an odd set of paintings that it was very
				difficult to enjoy them. that and the fact that they weren't anything that anyone knows about.
				<p />
				but then we got to "the" painting. the one that mike had been looking forward to seeing the entire trip. the
				<b>only</b> reason for us going to dresden.
				<p />
				after we found it, we didn't look through the rest of the museum at all. in fact mike sat and stared at the
				painting for a full half hour. (thats longer than we looked at the mona lisa, the winged victory, and the venus
				de milo put together)
				<p />
				after leanne pried mike away from the painting we made our way out of the museum and found our way to the train
				station. on the way back we stopped and got mike a brautwurst from a street vender. no trip to germany would be
				complete without a brautworst.
				<p />
				we then went into the train station where we got leanne a flat pretzel with pizza topping and mike a normal 
				pretzel. we ate those and then found out train. mike would like to add that the german trains are the nicest 
				trains in the world! the reasoning behind this is because they are crazy on time. we had 4 minutes to get from the
				train that we were on to the train that we needed to be on. the best part about it was that they had planned it so
				that all we needed to do was go across the platfrom. but what is even better than that is that the trains were on
				always on time. they all arrived when they said that the would, and the all left when they said that they would.
				you even got a nice little shcedule of the stops and all the connections at all of the stops and when you would
				be getting to the next stop, and when all the other trains would be leaving. it was really really nice.
				<p />
				we took the train some other small town, changed to a different train, and got to Munich at about 8 and had burger
				king for dinner.
				<p />
				we then got on our horrid train to italy (it was an italian train) and started our 20 hour voyage.

				we woke up early!, and then we walked in the cold to the bus stop,
				and waited in the cold for the bus, took it up to the train station, and then
				got onto the train to venice.
				<p />
				we had a very interesting ride to venice, but were excited casue we were on our
				way to venice.
				<p />
				when we got to venice, we were of course amazed at the whole water thing, cause you don't
				truly understand the whole its an island until you are there.
				<p />
				but seeing as in how we had been up since 5:00 am we were hungry so we went to this restaurant that
				was suggested in one of our travel books, and it was like a cafeteria for grown ups. you could pick
				what you wanted to have and then go and pay for it, and then sit with your tray and your food.
				<p />
				from there we went over to the hostels office, only to find out that they were closed until 3:00pm,
				so we went on our way wandering around the island to see if we could find stuff.
				<p />
				we did a pretty effective job of getting ourselves lost, and finding streets and bridges and all of
				that fun sort of thing that you normaly wouldn't see, but hey come on we are mike and leanne, we do
				things our way.
				<p />
				but we found the yellow signs that the book was talking about that lead us to St. Marks. after looking
				through the square and the basilica we went into the doge's palace and looked at stuff in there. found
				the prisons and a big mural that mike wanted to see.
				<p />
				after that we just walked around some more. and found ourselves by the water and a giant street that we could
				just walk on and stare at the water.
				<p />
				while on our walk we found a grocery store and bought some crossiants, and wine in juice boxes.
				<p />
				we sat and watched the sun set, and then went back to the hostel office.
				<p />
				upon our arrival we were greeted by a wonderfully kind woman. she got us all set for check in, and then
				called down her assistant, who happened to be her 10 year old son we think, and had him run us off to where
				we would be staying. and when we say run, we mean run. he was walking as fast as a little 10 year can walk and
				zig zagging through people. it was quite an experience.
				<p />
				when we got to our room we just crashed and slept.

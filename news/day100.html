				it is so hard to belive that we have been here for 100 days now! seemslike only yesterday we were hoping off
				the plane, and we both feel like even though we have seen and done so many things, there are still so many new things
				to discover. 
				<P />
				today we did discover something new.  on the very top ofjohn cabot there is a terrace that we had never been to, and never see anyone on.
				well we found the door to it, and it is beautiful and quiet and so well kept in comparison to the othe terraces.  mike and leanne were both enjoying
				the view, when suddenly the idea struck mike that if there were lights all around the terrace, and a full kitchen in the corner (not really
				sure of its purpose) then there must be electricity up here.  we did a little searching and found an outlet, and then to make things even better
				the wireless internet works up there, which is crazy because it works no where else in the school!
				<P /> 
				mike found his new office. he didnt move from his corner of the terrace all day while leanne was studious in classes.
				<P />
				also exciting today was the email that mike got saying that the web design job wants to interview him and know when he can start!! YAY!!
				<P />
				and when christy and leanne were finally able to pry mike from his new favorite spot, we had french taost with everyone at sonya and christy's.
				it is so crazy how such a simple thing like french taost can make so many people happy, it was wonderful.

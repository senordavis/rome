We ate some really good pastries and had				some strong caffe.				<p>				strangest thing, the coffee here isn't really coffee, its espresso. the other				funny thing about it is that its dirt cheap, but better than even the best coffee				either of us has ever tasted at home.				<p>				anyways. we listend to the normal "welcome to our school" stuff and got through				the rest of the stuff. we then headed out to try and get some things taken care				of for out Permisso de Soggiorno (permit to stay). We went to a photo shop to 				have more photos taken. then tried to go to the post office to buy italian				insurance. ate some lunch and went back to the school for another orientation				session.				<p>				after all of that we came home to the apartment to rest for a bit, and then went				back up to the school for a free dinner that the school had. it was held out in				one of the many beautiful courtyards eventhough it was very cold				tonight. nothing near as cold as the snow and winter from michigan, but without				proper coats and in comparison to the normal temperature during the day, and the				normal tempertarue in italy, quite cold.				<p>				well to home we go, we'll stop to grab a cappuchino to get warm and sleep in tommorow.				</div>				<hr size="1">				<div><a class="link2" href="../news.html">news</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="link2" href="day2.html">previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="link2" href="day4.html">next</a></div>			</td>	    </tr>	</table></body></html>

				today we woke up to more sun. it was goregous. we headed down to the gym to go work out first thing.
				after a little bit mike decided that his legs hurt to much from his graceful fall on monday so ohe went home
				while leanne ran for another 40 minutes.
				<p />
				after the gym we had some macaroni for lunch, and then just sat for a good while. Mike finished angels and demons, and
				leanne took a nap.
				<p />
				when leanne woke up, we ran to school so that she could get there on time. she went to class and then to tutoring. while she
				was doing all of this, mike worked on figureing out some things using a different programming language called php. he programmed the new script
				that is now powering the email form on the site.
				<p />
				we met up and then headed out to the residence to go to dinner at dave and liz's. we got there a little late, but food was good and we had a good time.
				<p />
				after dinner we walked home and crashed as soon as we got here.

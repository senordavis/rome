				today we slept in just a little cause we just needed it.
				<p />
				we got up and went over this restaurant across the street and had what is appernetly a netherlands
				breakfast. it was two fried eggs, 8 slices of toast, 4 slices of gouda, 2 large slices of ham, 2 big sub 
				buns, fresh squezzed orange juice, and your choice of tea or coffee. (of course this was for two people 
				cause we ordered 2 of them)
				<p />
				after breakfast we went on our way to see the van gogh museum. it opened at 10 and we got there at 10:45 
				and the lines were huge. we got into the museum and it was so packed that it was very difficult to see
				any of the paintings.
				<p />
				after the museum, we went to lunch at this place on the corner from where we were that looked really 
				really cool. we had some really good hot chocolate, and for dessert we had a traditional dutch apple pie.
				<p />
				after lunch we went to the train station to get our ticket to dresden.
				<p />
				once we had that all taken care of, we went to see the second museum that we wanted to go to, the anne
				frank house. we got there and had to wait in line. while in line we met a couple from san diego who were
				visiting family in the area. we talked to them in while in line.
				<p />
				when inside we walked through the building and it was amazing! it is the place where they actually hid.
				you got to see the entire thing. the warehouse, the offices, this annex, and the different bedrooms 
				inside the annex. you could see the bookcase that they had built infront of the door to get into the 	
				attic. you could even see the different pictures that anne had glued to the wall, and the original diary
				itself. it was very moving.
				<p />
				after that we found our way back to a haggen das that we had seen. we went in there and had some waffles
				with dutch ice cream and other fun things on top. (if you haven't guessed yet, we like waffles)
				<p />
				we sat there for a bit before making our way to the hard rock cafe that we saw. (if you haven't guessed
				this one, we like hard rock too.) we hung out there for dinner and enjoyed it very much.
				<p />
				afterwards we walked around the city before going back to the hostel for bed.

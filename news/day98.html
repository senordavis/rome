				so just as at the end of any semester, the closer it gets, the more you want it to be over.
				usually spring semester is worse than any other one cause you've gone from cold to warm, but
				hey what are you going to do.
				<p />
				we've been pretty lax about alot of things. the website, school work, deciding what to do.
				but today we decided to catch up. mike finished up the updates and uploaded it all. but only
				after lunch on the terrace on the very top of the school and after leanne had used the computer
				to reply to emails, and do a whole bunch of other fun things.
				<p />
				the terrace on the roof is gorgeous. portico's and flowers everywhere.
				<p />
				after leanne got out of class, we had a frustrating time with the library. we were going to start work
				on our art history paper for the end of the semster, but most of the books that we wanted to use where not there.
				<p />
				this would not be a problem, but two things made it thus.
				<p />
				first of we had to search the library using the library search which yeilded nothing. typing in what we are writing about you would think
				you could find something, but apparently giant monuments in rome are very obscure things.
				<p />
				we went to find a few of the random things we found after typing in even more broad search terms, and they were no where to be found.
				<p />
				the second problem made it even worse. we went and asked the library people to see if they could help us, and they got pissed at us for even
				thinking to ask them for help. then on top of that the books were supposed to be on reserve, but that only means that you can't take it out of the library
				if you are a visiting student. the book that leanne needed was on reserve but checked out even though the system that we looked it up said it was in
				but according to the library woman was "not updated and inferior to what they had behind the desk."
				<p />
				leanne was pissed like no other so she went home. mike worked on a few other things, and then went home to meet her.
				<p />
				we had PB&amp;J's for dinner and went to bed early.

				we are sick of this place and coming home tommorow!
				<p />
				april fools!
				<p />
				so that about the extant of the foolery for us, and pretty
				much for all of rome. they do have the whole april fools
				thing here, but its not a widely cared about thing.
				<p />
				but anyways, today at 10am (3am EST) the new <a href="http://www.photostyle.biz">photostyle</a> website
				was launched. mike has put alot of work into redesigning alot of the
				style to photostyle, some of the logos, and alot of code of the site.
				(all the stuff that you don't see when looking at the site)
				<p />
				also today sonya's and christy's families arrived in rome. we met them and talked
				to them for a bit up at the school.
				<p />
				this afternoon, leanne was taking pictures of christy's little sister,
				<p />
				after the photoshoot, we sat down at this bar over by the vatican and sat
				and talked for an hour and a half before making our way out to the pzzeria that we
				all go to whenever someone comes to rome.
				<p />
				one of the highlights of the evening was when leanne retaliated for the meat stealing
				incident of tuesday nights dinner by stealing almost all of the sausage off of mikes
				pizza.
				<p />
				we all sat around and talked and had a great time. unfortunatly when it came
				time for dessert there was only one tiramisu. so all those who wanted some
				passed it around.
				<p />
				sad news today though, leannes shoe is starting to break.
				<p />
				good news for today is that tommorow we leave for london.

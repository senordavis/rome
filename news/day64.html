				well not much going on today.
				<p />
				we decided not to go to art history this morning, cause it was the colosseum, which we already know about.
				and it was kinda cold and we didn't really want to be outside.
				<p />
				so instead we went and did what all good students who skip class do. we sat at school in the library,
				working on other things.
				<p />
				we went to italian when it was time to, and then home to just sit and relax for a bit.
				<p />
				tonight as per the calenders that we made up, dinner was at nikki's and mandy's apartment.
				<p />
				we didn't make it out to dinner. ( i know, the horror!) but we were not feeling well after having had sandwhiches
				from the caffe, so we went home and layed in bed trying to feel better.
				<p />
				tommorow though will be much more exciting because we have no classes, and will be exploring around rome. 
				or sitting in the library catching up on homework (papers for history of art class). but either way 
				there will be some definite excitement.

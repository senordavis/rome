				what a wonderful day today will be.
				<p />
				its st. patricks day, we're in rome, and we have nothing to do today.
				<p />
				well really thats not true, but nothing to pressing to do today that can't be
				gotten done and then take the rest of the day to relax.
				<p />
				because leanne didn't have her hummanities or histroy class today, and mike doesn't
				have class at all, we decided that today would be tax day. and that's exactly what it was.
				<p />
				leanne woke up early and did taxes. got through all of the information that we had
				with us here, and then just had to wait until it was late enough here to be able
				to call mom to get some more information.
				<p />
				from there we went to school to sumbit it all over the internet, and that was it.
				we had met up with some people and were talking about what to do later tonight.
				some of them were going to some bars close to them so we were just going to hang
				out in campo for some of the night and watch everyone else.
				<p />
				dave an liz, were thinking about coming out to campo, so we met up with them and
				hung out just drinking wine and looking at that crowd in campo. while we were sitting
				drinking our wine, christy walked by with the group of her room mates that was going
				out for one of their birthdays and she said that she would come back and find us before
				going home.
				<p />
				she came and found us and from there we went and she got a drink at another bar in campo
				and mike got a guiness. according to on of the priest at the church that we are going to
				truly celebrant catholics don't drink green beer, but guiness. (as do the irish)

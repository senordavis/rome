				today we were meeting agian at the arch of titus. leanne thinks that it should
				just be our classroom cause we have met there so often.
				<p />
				from there we walked up to the palotine hill, which is beautiful. we looked around
				there and did the whole class thing, and then went into the colosseum.
				<p />
				we then went home to have some lunch before going to Italian class. we had italian
				class outside cause it was so nice.
				<p />
				after class leanne went to work, and mike went to school to update the site. we met
				up later at Termini to book our train tickets for the next two weekends, and spring break.
				<p />
				when we got back to the apartment we went and worked out for about an hour before going back
				home to shower and head off to dinner.
				<p />
				dinner tonight was at the girls who live in the apartment below us. we hung out for a bit, and had a good time.
				afterwards, we came home and just hung out for a bit before going to sleep.

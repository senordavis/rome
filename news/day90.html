				this morning, leanne woke up and worked some more on the computer getting more stuff done for photostyle.
				mike of course did what he always does and slept in.
				<p />
				we went to the gym when it opened and tried explaining to the attendant about how our passes got stolen, but
				he wasn't the brightest crayon in the box, and he didn't speak to much english so communicating with him was a bit hard.
				<p />
				after the gym we came home, showered, and then went out for lunch. after lunch we went up to the school and sat on the computer
				getting some stuff done. at 4 we went to the store and did groccery shopping for the week, and for dinner tommorow night.
				<p />
				afterwards we came home dropped everything off, and then went and walked around for abit cause it was sunny out.
				<p />
				we came home and sat for a bit, and then went to church.
				<p />
				after church we just came home and went to bed.

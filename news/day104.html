				today we both woke up at the same time. we layed in bed and talked for a bit, and then decided
				that we were hungry and because we couldn't go shopping yesterday cause it was italian labor day,
				had to go to a cafe for breakfast.
				<p />
				after breakfast we headed off to do laundry. while there we had tons of people come in and ask us how
				you were supposed to do everything. why the needed to ask us we aren't sure. there are signs all over
				the place instructing you what to do, but all the italian people decided it would be a better idea to
				ask the non italian speaking people.
				<p />
				after our adventure at the laundromat, we stopped at the bookstore and got some books to read for the
				rest of the time here, and hopefully for while on the plane ride back home in a couple days.
				<p />
				we came home and dropped everything off, and then headed out to the residence to meet up with everyone for
				a good old sunday dinner. todd had decided it was high time that he cooked us up some good home cooking. so we
				had some salad, mashed potatoes, green beans, chicken and gravey. we had a really good time, and food was really good.
				everyone went home full.
				<p />
				we came home and mike started work on his paper again, while leanne started to read her new book. we had discovered that our
				stove was leaking a small amount of gas so we called the school's emergency line and they sent someone out that came and fixed
				everything for us.
				<p />
				we later went to church and then came home. mike finished up his paper and leanne made some rice and beans for dinner.

				so today we still didn't have hot water.
				<p />
				as a recap, or maybe as a first, we didn't have hot water when we came home
				from florence.
				<p />
				but we dealt. we got ready for school had some breakfast, and went off to school.
				we sat in the library, and just hung out doing some different work. leanne read
				about venice and what we are going to do this weekend. we did some work on the
				computer and uploaded pictures to our <a class="link2" href="http://www.shutterfly.com" target="_blank">shutterfly</a> account. (its a nice little digital
				pictures management service)
				<p />
				while sitting there some people from leannes class came down (before class) and let her
				know that class was canceled for the week. so we then finished up what we were doing,
				and went home for lunch.
				<p />
				we started cooking a little bit later, and slowly everyone began arriving for the feast
				of bruschetta and spaghetti. we hung out, talked, laughed, and then they all went home.
				leanne called her mom, and then after that we went to bed.

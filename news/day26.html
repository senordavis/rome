You know the usual lovers in				paris thing.				<p />				from there we walked across the street and up the steps to the place where everyone takes their picture				at, and helped out some other people with taking their pictures. after sitting there for a while we decided				to go to hard rock cafe. we weren't very hungry, but we ate anyways. we got these really good nachos, and 				a great burger, and then a plate of dessert nachos, which are these cinnamon and sugar chips with different				fruit on top, ice cream in the center, and then chocolate syrup drizzeld all over it. quite yummy i would say.				<p />				after dinner, we headed back to the tower to see it at night, which was gorgeous by the way. went up to the				top to see the view of paris from up there. after we had done all the toursity things for the day we headed				back to the hotel to sleep and prepare for tommorow.				</div>				<hr size="1">				<div><a class="link2" href="../news.html">news</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;					 <a class="link2" href="day25.html">previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;					 <a class="link2" href="day27.html">next</a></div>			</td>	    </tr>	</table></body></html>

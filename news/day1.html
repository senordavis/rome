We were able to pronounce					the name of the place very well. The only problem was that there is a road that is the same name					of the place that all the other students are at so he took us to the begining of that road.					<p />					after about 45 minutes in the taxi, he found the place and we met with the group.					<p />					the way home was much easier and we crashed right when we got here.					<p />					so far so good, we'll see what tommorow brings.					</div>				<hr size="1">				<div>					<a class="link2" href="../news.html">news</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;					<a class="inactive">previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;					<a class="link2" href="day2.html">next</a>				</div>			</td>	    </tr>	</table></body></html>

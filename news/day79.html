				today we were headed off from amsterdam to dresden. all just to see a painting that mike loves.
				<p />
				we woke up early in the morning, and went over to the cafe across the street again for breakfast. today the
				waitress/bartender served us something a little different than yesterday, but it was still good none the less.
				<p />
				from breakfast we came back to our room, made sure we had everything packed up, and went on our way to find
				the tram that would take us back to the station. we ended up getting on one of them, and because we had read 
				that they all go to the train station, we didn't think to check to make sure.
				<p />
				we ended up having to get off of it and get on a different one.
				<p />
				we got back to the station with enough time of course. when we got there we walked around and found a store
				to buy some bread to be able to make sandwhiches with on the train.
				<p />
				at about 11 our train took off to berlin where we would switch to a different train and make our way to 
				dersden.
				<p />
				we arrived in dresden and stopped in the ticket office to change our ticket that we had gotten in rome.
				<p />
				we had a little bit of trouble with it, but eventually got everything to work.
				<p />
				we then had to find our way to the mexican hostel.
				<p />
				we got on the tram that the directions said to get on, but it didn't go to where we needed to go. instead it
				went to the tram depot and apparently was done running for the night. we got off it in the tram garage and 
				were confused beyond belief. the tram people were like "what the hell are you doing here!" they were speaking
				in german so of course that is what we think they said.
				<p />
				the cleanning lady and the conducter guy were both laughing at us, but the conducter eventually took us to a
				tram stop where trams were leaving and told us to get on one.
				<p />
				we finally made it to our hostel and just crashed.

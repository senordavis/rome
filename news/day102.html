			  	<div class="main">
				today we got up early so that mike could meet his class at the train station for a 
				field trip to ostia antica.  its a small desserted town that used to be the ancient
				roman port city, back when the river and the sea met at a different place than they do now.
				mike got to see all sorts of ruins, kind of like at pompeii, but not as cool.  anyway he had fun 
				with his class (which is all of our friends except leanne, erica and sonya) and his professor, good
				ole jens.
				<P />
				leanne spent the whole day at the library working on her art history paper, yay its done! and waiting 
				for everyone to get back from their field trip.
				<P />
				when everyone got back we met up at hard rock for happy hour!! that was tons of fun. we all got tons
				of different appatizers to eat (since they were all half off) and had a couple of drinks (two at a time
				of course because they were two for one) and we all had a ton of fun.
				<P />
				then came the realization that even though we were a bit tipsy, it waas still light out!!
				<P />
				some of us went shopping, others went home, and some of us just wandered around rome killing time before 
				going off to bed.

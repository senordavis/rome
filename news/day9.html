We got the books for leanne's				class, our books for italian, and then walked around the area looking at what shops where there.				<p>				we got alittle hungry and went into a mc donalds cause mike had a craving for some fries, and then once				in there decided to just get food. and when you hear that mickey d's are all regional, you don't really				realize it until you go to one in a country that isn't in any way americanized. they still use the old				styrofoam sandwhich containers. and it was also the largest mc donalds that either of us has ever seen.				they had another counter by the front entrance that was just for the dessert menu, and had a fresh salad bar.				<p>				afterwards we stopped into united colors of benetton, and got leanne a sweater a t-shirt and a really cool bag.				from there we headed homeput everything away and went to bed.				</div>				<hr size="1">				<div><a class="link2" href="../news.html">news</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="link2" href="day8.html">previous</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="link2" href="day10.html">next</a></div>			</td>	    </tr>	</table></body></html>

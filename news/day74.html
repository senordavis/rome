				<div class="subtitle">WE ARE GOING TO LONDON!</div>				
				<div class="date">Friday, 2 April, 2004</div>
				<br>
				<div class="main">
				today the alarm went off at 5 in the morning. Leanne was quick to wake up, and
				turn it off and go back to sleep. we got up an hour later to get everything
				together and leave for the airport.
				<p />
				we at some breakfast, and put our packs on and headed out to the taxi stop to get
				ride out to the small military airport that our plane flew out of. now just so you know
				yes its a millitary airport, but we flew on an actual airline. apparently they just
				converted it into both.
				<p />
				we got to london at about 12:20 london time. which is odd cause its and hour before the
				time in rome. our next journey was to find out how to get to actual london.
				<p />
				we found this bus service and decided to take that. it took forever to get into
				london, but we finally made it at about 2:30.
				<p />
				when we got off the bus we walked up towards our hostel, and stopped at the hard rock to
				see if we could get reservation. well they don't take reservations on weekends, so we 
				would just have to come back later.
				<p />
				we then went off to the hostel, made it there, and got all checked in situated, and then
				headed out to find what we could go and do.
				<p />
				we soon realized that after walking around for a bit, everything was starting to close, and
				all the night life stuff was starting to open. so seeing as in how all of the tourist stuff was
				not accesible, we went and saw the passion of the christ, with english subtitles.
				<p />
				after wards we went down to hard rock, which was really difficult because of what we just watched.
				but, we knew that we had to go on and enjoy our time here.
				<p />
				after dinner and dessert, we headed back to the hostel, got ready for bed, and tried to sleep through
				an old mans snoring which was as loud as a chainsaw, and sounded like it too.

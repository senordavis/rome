				<div class="main">
				after not having gone to our art history class last week, we decided
				that it would be good to go and learn something.
				<p />
				we ended up back by the forum again today and just kinda listened to
				our prof talk and talk and talk. leanne pretty much found it review
				for here because he talked alot more on the history of rome, which
				she has already gone over.
				<p />
				while out there, it started to rain. this made it very fun for mike
				who was trying to take notes.
				<p />
				after class we went to a pizzeria and got some pizza and then went to
				italian class to take our quiz.
				<p />
				after class we hung out at the school for a bit and then went home
				before making the trek out to the residence to have dinner with the
				<a class="link2" href="http://www.friends.mikeandleanne.com">friends</a>, at erica's place. todd and her cooked
				up some stew like thing that had potatoes, some sausage, peppers, and chesse.
				<p />
				while leanne was on the phone talking with mom, mike stole all the sausage off
				her plate. (bad mike). we played a game of uchre and got into a small discussion
				about how it is a michigan game and that counting points with 5's is much smarter
				than the ohio way of doing it with 6's and 4's. (you really had to be there).
				<p />
				after dinner we walked home rather quickly and went to bed.

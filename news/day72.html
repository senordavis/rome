				it's pouring! thats pretty much what the whole day was.
				just lots and lots of rain.
				<p />
				yesterday leanne bought a book. why is that a big deal?
				well more so cause since she bought it she hasn't been able
				to not read it.
				<p />
				its called angels and demons. it is the book written before
				the divinci code (which we will be buying when she is done
				with her next paper for class).
				<p />
				its a really, really, good book and the story takes place in rome,
				so its very cool to be in the place where the story happens.
				<p />
				today mike worked alot more on photostyle while leanne was in class.
				he got most of it all done and it should go up tommorow.
				<p />
				after sitting at school for a while, we went home and leanne sat and read
				some more of her book, and mike did some more work on photostyle.
				<p />
				we were supposed to go to dinner at mandy's tonight but leanne had felt like
				staying at home all day, so she stayed in bed reading while mike made the
				walk to the residence himself for taco night.
				<p />
				(just as a note taco night was great and mike had 8 &frac12; tacos.)
				<p />
				when mike got home we both stayed up some more so that leanne could read,
				and mike could finish some things for photostyle.

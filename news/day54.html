				today was amazing!
				<p />
				blue sky, no clouds, lots of sun! it was great. we just hung out in rome
				and took in the beautiful weather. we meet up with our friend christy and her
				friend patrick and went to this really really nice (and a bit expensive) place
				for lunch in campo.
				<p />
				the food there was awesome, and we enjoyed ourselves very much.
				<p />
				after lunch we went to blue ice for some gelato. while the other two got small
				cones, mike and leanne went all the way and got the whopping big waffel cone(thats alot of ice cream).
				<p />
				afterwards we came back to the apartment to figure out what we were going to do
				for the rest of the night. we came up with the idea to go out to this restaurant that
				according to all the travel books that we have, is supposed to be amazing, and cheap.
				<p />
				we went there for dinner, and then came home and just relaxed. Chrsity ended up spending the
				night cause she had to be back out here tommorow morning for something, and its about an
				hour walk from the residence so we offered to let her sleep here, and thus she did.
				<p />
				her friends also chilled for a bit and before calling a cab to take them to the airport.
				<p />
				it was a wonderfully gorgeous day. we got some homework done, and all the stuff that we have
				collected for the scrap book organized.

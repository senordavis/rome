				so today we slept in, real late, because yesterday wore us out.  we had planned on hanging out
				and doing homework, but after lunch it just looked so nice out, so we walked out to campo and wandered through 
				piazza navona.  we had a lot of fun just wandering with no where in particular to go.  
				<p /> 
				we decided to head back home, and mike had a craving for gelato.  at blue ice, the woman who works there now recognizes us, and
				is uber nice, she always tops off the gelato cups a little fuller then is necessary. needless to say we had quite the cup of 
				gelato.
				<p />
				something told us it was time to head home, and we no sooner got upstairs and settled down for homework, and it started to pour.
				and then out of nowhere, it started to hail. seriously. it hailed. and then about thirty minutes later it was sunny again.
				<p />
				mike was craving beef for dinner, so we made burgers. they were way yummy.  mikes getting good at this cooking thing now that
				he knows how to make burger patties.  plus how better to get ready for the wings hockey game than with cheese burgers, chips and coke?
				<p />
				thats the true excitement of the day, we found a bar that said it was playing nhl live, turns out there was a wings game at 3 est, and so 9 rome time.
				but in reality, live meant "re-live" and the game was at 1am. so, those two avid wings fans who went to the bar at 8:30 to watch the game were completely 
				drunk by the time the nfl draft ended (four hours later) and the hockey started. and to make it better, the nfl draft was on espn who was giving 
				score updates for the game in progress, so we knew the scores before watching the game.
				<p />
				but on a happy note, the bar makes amazing capiroskas! the strawberry and sugar vodka drink we learned about a couple nitse ago, way yummy. and at half
				off for ladies nite, leanne had her share. she also discovered that poptart should make a new flavor, nutella poptart! at the bar
				they had toast and nutella, and needing some solids for the alcohol, we ordered it. but it was more like a poptart crust with nutella 
				on top, really good!
				<p />
				and then we came home and crashed hard, sleep came welcomingly.

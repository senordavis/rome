				today we realized just how soon it was until we would be back in michigan.  and it wasn't so much
				the number of days that suddenly hit us, those have always been in our minds, but it was the 
				massive amounts of thoughts that encountered both of us today.
				<p />
				leanne was about to have a panic attack about all of the things she needed to do for school.  in the 
				next week she needs to write three essays for history, a fourth one for extra credit, and prepare six
				essays for art history as a way to study for the exam (its an essay exam and will be two of the six 
				topics that we recieved as review) and she needs to study for italian, and suddenly come to an understanding of
				her humanities class so that she can pass the oral final, the worst part of this is that she is slightly intimidated
				by the professor and she has to talk to him for an hour and appear confident in her thoughts and ideas.  
				<p />
				on top of school there is of course all of the things that one must do when preparing to leave a four month
				vacation, like packing!
				<p />
				mike's panic attack was more rooted in the things that we would have to do once we arrived at home.  and he too
				has finals creeping up on him.  an italian final that he swears will ruin whatever is left of his spanish if he studies for
				it, and will ruin the perfect four point semester he has going if he doesn't study, and he too has the six art history essays
				to write, an art history project to finish and a second art history final to study for.
				<p />
				on top of everything that we are worrying about, we just want to relax and enjoy these last few days in rome, and not with books!
				one would think that we were here to study or something with all of this academic stuff we need to do!?!

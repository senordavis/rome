				<div class="subtitle">papers, another italian movie and clouds</div>				
				<div class="date">Thursday, 29 April, 2004</div>

				so today was cloudy, that made the day a little depressing because we found that new terrace and then couldnt 
				use it today.  but we spent the morning doing some work on our art history research papers.  
				<P />
				lunch today was fun though, we cooked up the zatarans black beans and rice mix that mom sent us.  just the smell 
				of the spices made our mouths water, it has been so long since we have had anything spicy.  tasted awesome! (thanks
				mom, good call) but, after the afternoon and night that leanne had she is reconsidering the taco bell she is craving
				for her first food back at home.  apparently after three months of no spices, the tummy doesnt adjust back quickly.
				<P />
				and for italian class we watched another movie. these italian movies are crazy. yet another two hours of people
				cheating on each other, and tons of swear words, strange plotlines. we will not miss italian movies.
				<P/>
				after class, leanne called it a day, the tummy needed some rest and home sounded good.  mike spent a few hours working
				on his paper at school and then came home.
				<P /> 
				we needed to make sure we were well rested, tomarrow is happy hour at hard rock!
